**For those interested to pursue Python and data analysis, here are some starter tips to help you get started**

**Common python terms you will hear in the workshop are**
- Import packages
- View the dataframe
- Merge the data
- Group data 
- Visualize the data

**Here some resources for you to get started.**
- [Python concepts 101](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-fundamentals-for-data-science/#:~:text=A%20basic%20Python%20curriculum%20can%20be%20broken%20down,functions%204%20Object-oriented%20programming%20and%20using%20external%20libraries)
    - From this link, you can get a brief view into important concepts that Python is built on.
- [Dataframe concepts using Pandas] (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html)
    - From this link, you can learn about the most popular data structure called Dataframe from Pandas package. This package is used by analysts to perform all steps of cleaning. You can also use this package to visualize data. However, other visualization packages are used in routine practice. An example is the one that will be discussed in the workshop.
- [Visualization] (https://plotly.com/python/getting-started/)
    - From this link, you can get an brief introduction of Plotly.
- [Python course] (https://docs.python-guide.org/intro/learning/)
    - This link is a great resource to help you get started on Python.    
- When you encounter new terminology, you can paste your question in [Stack overflow] (https://stackoverflow.com/) into the Search bar. Answers to previously asked similar question will appear. Alternately, you can also ask ChatGPT. 


**Want to try some code?**

Here are the steps you can follow to try Python code development.
1. Follow the steps outlined in [gmail setup](./gmail_setup.md) to get started on a Google Colab account.
2. In the [notebook](./test_notebook.ipynb), create a new cell. Paste a code that you learn from the [Python course](https://docs.python-guide.org/intro/learning/) into the cell and run it. If you encounter an error, paste the error message into ChatGPT or Stack Overflow to help you understand what the error means and to get help on fixing the error.

**Happy Coding and Learning!**
